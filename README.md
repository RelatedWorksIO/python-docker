This repo is two things:
    * A shared library of analytics code used across RW clients. Includes things like fetching data from databases and styling visualiazations.
    * A template for analytics projects with accompanying docker scaffolding that runs the code.

This repo uses it's own template/scaffolding. You can find the documentation for using it in the [project-specific readme](PROJECT_README.md).
